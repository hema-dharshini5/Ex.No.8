# **Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation**

**Date :17/11/25**
**Register No : 212223220034**

## **Aim:**

To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts.


## **Procedure:**



# **Image 1: Sunset Beach Scene**

### **Analysis:**

* **Objects:** Ocean waves, sandy beach, sun setting on the horizon
* **Colors:** Orange, yellow, blue, light brown
* **Lighting:** Warm sunset lighting
* **Background:** Open sea and glowing horizon
* **Style:** Realistic photography

### **Basic Prompt:**

“A beach with waves during sunset.”

### **Refined Prompt:**

“A realistic photograph of a peaceful beach during sunset, with gentle waves crashing on the sandy shore, a glowing orange sun at the horizon, and warm golden light reflecting on the water.”


# **Image 2: Bowl of Fresh Fruits**

### **Analysis:**

* **Objects:** Bowl, apples, grapes, bananas
* **Colors:** Red, green, yellow, purple, brown
* **Lighting:** Soft indoor lighting
* **Background:** Simple wooden table surface
* **Style:** Realistic still-life photography

### **Basic Prompt:**

“A bowl of fruits on a table.”

### **Refined Prompt:**

“A realistic still-life image of a ceramic bowl filled with apples, grapes, and bananas placed on a wooden table, captured under soft indoor lighting with clear textures and natural shadows.”



## **Tools Used:**

* **DALL·E (OpenAI)**
* **Stable Diffusion**



## **Prompts Used:**

* **Image 1:**
  “A realistic photograph of a peaceful beach during sunset, with gentle waves crashing on the sandy shore, a glowing orange sun at the horizon, and warm golden light reflecting on the water.”

## **Comparison Report:**

### **Image 1 (Beach):**

The generated reproduction closely matched the lighting and the overall mood of the sunset. Minor differences were observed in the shape of the waves and cloud formations.

### **Image 2 (Fruit Bowl):**

The generated image resembled the original very well in terms of color tones and arrangement. Slight variations appeared in the texture of the fruits and bowl shape.



## **Conclusion:**

By analyzing and refining prompts, the AI-generated images were able to reproduce the originals with high accuracy. This highlights the importance of prompt engineering, detailed observation, and iterative refinement when working with text-to-image models.
